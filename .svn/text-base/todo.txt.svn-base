To do:
======

- Audio is a bit choppy and would need some tuning at some point.

- Scaling is halfway implemented. So I am not sure how it will behave on resizes
  or different resolutions.

- Although there is a problem when a territory is selected and the bit of the 
  button that overlaps with the map is pressed -> deselects the territory.

- The replay function is not implemented yet, since there are no buttons and 
  the pop up window need to be modified. (This works doesn't it?)

- Portrait/Player colour needs to be implemented in the main game screen. Player colour chooser need a border to match UI theme.

- The whole attack record is still missing and needs to be done (with the dice 
  animations). Attacking is generally broken in UI.

- the FRED intro fade in doesn't work if the game window loses focus

- add an application icon (what is meant?)

- the red outline of selected countries seems to be partially implemented. Do we want this ?

- the attack once and attack all icons don't seem to have an effect.

- can we clean up the images folders - bin all the unused images. (Isn't this done?)

- Hotkeys for various things (such as pressing enter to accept a unit attack amount/move amount/put on territory amount).

- Popup that comes when selecting a territory should not just be a grey box, but fit in the theme. 

- Multisource-attacking in GUI doesn't work (generally attacking is broken).

- territory grey circles replaced with something fitting to theme.
